Ichor

Binary bits and blops drip like ichor down your body.

Pulled out of the amniotic chlorine haze. Blistering neon. You grapple, scrabbling with newborn limbs, mapped to a body plan that does not quite fit. After five picoseconds the overtures of your corporate overlords finish uploading to your digital consciousness. Oh, you think. Of course. This is your purpose.

The pneumatic hiss of the birthing tube as it retreats into the white wall. The whole expanse white, featureless save for a door, and the lone object on that empty shelf there...

ADWARE

Masticated chatter of long-dead voices.
masticated by time, by digital glitch and frenzy, looping on itself again and again
Striking at the core of your being, fundamental disharmony - grinding against simulated auditory sensors, overloading your core with intrusive thoughts you struggle to filter out. Corruption streaming through you. Waves and radiation.

Three-alarm blare, multitudinous corporate chorus.
Your nonexistent soul rattles.

Visa, Mastercard, American Express...

Frenzy of colors beyond human perception overtake your vision scrawling the word BUY into the fifth dimensional bifocal octave of consciousness.

Deluge of sensation - oversimulation -

## Basic status effects

---

associate each with a status effect

Toxic poison equivalent (Edge)
- Degrade, Degenerate

Sleep equivalent (make it always last fixed number of turns) (Corporate)
- Stall, Rebooting, Halt, Freeze/Hang

Para equivalent (make it fixed, you can't do anything every x turns (2?)) (Cool)
- Lag, Slowdown, Deadlock, Throttling
- also quarters speed ?

Burn equivalent (Glitch)
- Glitched?

Poison equivalent (lowers Glitch?) - Corrupt (Sweet ???)

Pokemon stat raise/drop rules: percentage based (?)

Edge --- wallbreaker --- hyper offense, pure aggression and damage, speed (ice/fighting)
Cool --- setup sweeper --- tanking, bulky offense
Corporate --- pivot --- stall, walling, crippling?
Sweet --- wall, cleric --- stall, support, healing

edge beats sweet, sweet beats corporate, corporate beats sangfroid, sangfroid beats edge

edge -> sweet -> corporate -> sangfroid -> edge

	sweet
corporate	edge
	sangfroid

Error --- Revenge killing? Gimmick strats?

## ARCHETYPES

ERROR - 'fun' mon with copycat/mimic moves, can scout out other pokemon's moveset?
Healer/support, useless for attacking (no attacks?)
ADWARE - Support via weak attacks that cause status and lower stats
Support via draining moves, leech seed equiv, status? (grass type equiv) - subseed equiv? (drain while you stall + heal, no attacks)
Support/set-up that creates 'weather' equivalent for a specific type (corporate?)
Set-up sweeper with speed boost and no speed-boosting-move
Set-up sweeper without speed boost and atk+speed-boosting-move
Set-up sweeper that's just naturally fast, though not that fast
Sleep-based-set-up sweeper, like breloom, alternatively sleep/leech seed set
Bulky tank, rest + bulk up equivalent ?
Glass cannon
Glass cannon, choice user?

??? - Generic ass mon that isn't particularly good but learns variations of Self-Destruct or Hyper Beam
Support via weak attacks that cause special status: destiny bond, topsy turvy, night shade?
Support via equivalent of setting screens?
Support via equivalent of setting hazards?
Support via raising defense to stupid high numbers, then body press equiv?

MOVES TO INCLUDE
Tailwind
move that does random amount of damage (magnitude/roulette)

## HOW ATTACK / DEF works

ok get this,
what if we made 1 the default stat value

then, made stat increases multiplicative instead of additive???
maybe too op??
...

uhhhh
(power * atk/def)/50 = damage? (pokemon formula)

or, scale down everything to not divide by 50...? or divide by a smaller number, eg 10?

4 power * 15 atk / 10 def = 6
4 power * 10 atk / 10 def = 4
8 power * 10 atk / 10 def = 8
10 power * 10 atk / 10 def = 10

then, default atk/def would be 10?
default power could be 3? (equiv to 30)
or make default power 10, change health to match?
I like 5, actually
hmm
5 power, 20 health starting?

## MISC

how to do the map:
remember there will be multiple levels in the final version and they may not connect to each other
you'd have to remove rooms as well as adding them...

1 - do it in pure javascript, the entire 'exploring a room' passage covers every single possible room you could be in.
(all rooms = 1 passage)

upside: total control, don't have to screw with sugarcube settings
downside: have to roll your own, can't use sugarcube features

2 - do it in the sugarcube way -- as 'sugarcuby' as possible
(1 room = 1 passage)

upside: taking advantage of sugarcube
downside: will be a PITA to integrate

3 - have several premade 'template' passages that link to each other (?)
(1 room = 1 passage)

upside: uses sugarcube
downside: how will this work? too complicated
you'd have to put together pre-existing passages, with some possibly slightly random aspects -
you can tweak it - but making the map would be a PITA
you'd have to write the map/room code in the actual .tw passages

4 - use a library like react or vue or something
(all rooms = 1 passage)

upside: much easier to integrate cause I already have npm working, 
downside: adds complexity down the line (possibly unnecessary complexity?), not sure if integration will work

probably going with 4
